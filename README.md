# odin-recipes
Project: Recipes | The Odin Project

Since I try to eat less and less meat, this project should be about flexitarian <-> vegetarian dishes.

# Life should be about balance.

By the end of this project:
1) I should be able to successfully build a recipes page (HTML) and style it (CSS) by modifying an existing template
2) The project should look good and be responsive on a few devices

PS. When I first started TOP, this project wasn't included in the Foundations courses.
